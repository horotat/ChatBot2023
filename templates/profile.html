                <p>The current study investigates the effectiveness of chatbots on second language learning. The experiment involves adult second-language English speakers at the University of Hradec Kralove. Each participant will have conversation sessions with a chatbot called Alex for four consecutive weeks and three times each week. Each session takes around 10 minutes. The total estimatino of the time spent by the end of four weeks is between 150 to 180 minutes. Before and after the experiment, there are forms to fill in, to study and understand the effects of chatbots for language learning.</p>

                <p>Participation in the experiment is <strong>voluntary</strong>, meaning you could withdraw your participation at any point. Each participant chats with virtual conversational buddy who is a language model and is not powered by a human to produce the responses.</p>
            
            <h2>RESPONSIBLE RESEARCHER</h2>
                <p><a href="https://kth.se/profile/alimk">Alireza Mahmoudi Kamelabad</a></p></br>
                <p>For any matter regarding your data, you can contact the reponsible researcher.</p>            
            <h2>DATA</h2>
            
                <h3>COLLECTION AND PROCESSING</h3>
                
                    <p>This is all the information collected during the experiment and nothing more:</p>
                
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Chat logs with the chatbot</strong>: we will store all the chat logs with the virtual tutor Alex and analyze them to improve the system and study them to find the problems in the design and study how language learning happens with the chatbot. Along with the logs, the timing of the chats is also recorded. No password or information about personal computers is stored.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pre-test and Post-test</strong>:&nbsp;The answers on the pre- and post-test for the assessment of learning and setting the experiment.</li>
                        <li><strong>Information about participant's Language Knowledge, gender, education level, field of study</strong>:&nbsp;In the forms, we ask the participants about their language knowledge, gender, and language education history to study these factors concerning technology-assisted language learning.</li>
                    </ul>
                
                <h3>STORAGE</h3>
                
                    <p>All these data will be stored at the secure digital infrastructures of KTH Royal Institute of Technology and do not exit the digital borders of the European Union. All the collected data will remain available for at least the duration of the e-LADDA project (end of 2026) and if required by KTH for ten years. Collecting data is necessary for participation, and rejecting equals to withdraw from participation (the checkboxes below). After the experiment, data will be anonymized and cannot be traced back to any individual person.</p>
                
                <h3>ACCESS</h3>
                
                    <p>The responsible researcher is the person who has full access to the stored data. The other researchers of the project could access the data just for the period of their direct involvement in this particular study. If the signee agrees, the data could be available to the other researchers within the e-LADDA network, KTH and Hradec Kralove university.</p>
                
                <h3>ACCESSIBILITY, MODIFICATION, AND REMOVAL</h3>
            
                    <p>Participants can withdraw from the experiment at anytime before, during, or after the experiment and request access, modification, or complete removal of their data. This is possible by directly contacting the responsible researcher (until 2026) and the KTH Data Protection Officer (DPO) at:<a href="mailto:dataskyddsombud@kth.se">dataskyddsombud@kth.se</a> afterward. Should you have any problem or face any threat regarding your data, don't hesitate to get in touch with the DPO before 2026 as well.</p>
            
            <h2>BENEFITS AND RISKS</h2>
            
                <p>By participating in this experiment, you will help us develop and design better technology towards fair language learning experience. You will get the chance to try our latest developments as the first people and also play a role in this development.</p>
            
                <p>There are no physical or psychological risks for the participation in this experiment.</p>
